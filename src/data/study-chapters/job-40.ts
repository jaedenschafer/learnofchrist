/**
 * Job 40 — Job&apos;s Silence
 *
 * After God&apos;s torrent of questions, Job responds with profound silence. "Behold,
 * I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth."
 * He cannot argue with the Creator. He cannot respond to such majesty. And God introduces
 * Behemoth—a creature of terrible power. The implication: there are forces in the world
 * far beyond human control or understanding.

He has been shown the vastness of creation, the power of wild things, the intricate beauty of what he does not control. And now God introduces Behemoth—a creature of such terrible strength that it can barely be comprehended. Through Behemoth, God reveals that there are forces in creation that even the strongest human cannot govern.',
