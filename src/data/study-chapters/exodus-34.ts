/**
 * Exodus 34 — God renews the covenant.
 *
 * After the people break the first tablets at the golden calf, Moses ascends Sinai again.
 * God renews the covenant on new tablets and reveals His name: merciful, gracious, longsuffering,
 * abundant in goodness and truth. The twin Hebrew words chesed (steadfast covenant love) and
 * emet (truth/faithfulness) appear twice in verses 6–7, and reappear in the New Testament
 * (John 1:14: "full of grace and truth"). Moses' face shines so brightly the people fear,
 * and he wears a veil except when speaking to God. A chapter about how God meets failure
 * with fresh mercy, and the radiance that comes from standing in His presence.

    'Exodus 34 opens after catastrophe. The people have broken covenant at the golden calf — they have made and worshiped an idol while Moses is still on Sinai receiving God&apos;s law. The tablets are shattered. The agreement is broken. But instead of withdrawing, God does something stunning: He comes down and renews the covenant on fresh tablets. He reveals His name more fully than ever — not as judge, but as merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth. It is the same God, but the same people now encounter Him through failure, and through forgiveness.',
    'The chapter ends with Moses descending the mountain, his face radiant from standing in God&apos;s presence. The people are afraid to come near him, so he wears a veil except when he speaks to God. Paul will unpack this veil image in 2 Corinthians 3 — in Christ, the veil is removed, and we are transformed from glory to glory. Exodus 34 is a story about what happens when a broken people meet an unbroken God.',
