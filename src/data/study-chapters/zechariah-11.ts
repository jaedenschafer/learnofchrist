    'Zechariah 11 is one of the Bible&apos;s most explicitly messianic chapters, though it is clothed in parable and symbolic action. A shepherd comes to tend God&apos;s flock, but he is rejected. He is paid thirty pieces of silver—the price of a slave—and casts them into the temple treasury. Matthew 27:9 quotes this verse as fulfilled when Judas betrays Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. The chapter depicts the rejection of the Messiah and the consequences of that rejection.',
