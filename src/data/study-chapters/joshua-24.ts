    'Joshua 24 is the final chapter of the book, and one of the most electrifying in all Scripture. The aging general gathers every tribe of Israel at Shechem—elders, judges, officers, every person—to stand before God and renew the covenant that binds them. But this is not a ceremony of rubber-stamping. Joshua does something extraordinary: he recites Israel&apos;s entire history in God&apos;s own voice, from Abraham to that very moment, and then strips away every comfortable assumption and asks the hardest question: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve."',
    'What makes this chapter extraordinary is how Joshua refuses easy faith. When the people cry "We will serve the Lord," he doesn&apos;t celebrate—he warns them. "Ye cannot serve the Lord," he says. "He is a jealous God." He will not forgive casual commitment. And only after testing them three times, after the people affirm their choice with full eyes open, does he establish the covenant and set up a stone as witness. This is not a feel-good ending to a military conquest. It is a funeral, a farewell, a father who will not leave his children with illusions.',
    'The chapter closes as Joshua dies at 110—and the very next phrase is haunting: "And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord." The generation that *saw* God work remained faithful. It is the ones who only *heard* the stories—the ones yet to come—who will drift into the chaos of Judges. Generational discipleship matters. The stone stands as a witness to what happens when we remember.',
