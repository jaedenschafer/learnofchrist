/**
 * Numbers 24 — Balaam&apos;s Third and Fourth Oracles
 *
 * Balaam was hired to curse Israel, but his mouth opened to bless instead.
 * Three times the Spirit came upon him and he prophesied. In his fourth oracle,
 * without enchantment, seized by the Spirit, he speaks one of the most explicit
 * Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament: the Star and Scepter that shall
 * rise out of Israel. Christ recognized this prophecy as about Him. The Dead
 * Sea Scrolls understood it this way. Bar Kochba, &quot;Son of the Star,&quot;
 * three centuries later, led a failed rebellion partly on this text.
 *
 * The voice of this chapter is startling. God&apos;s purposes use even those who
 * don&apos;t love Him. Even a foreign prophet, hired to destroy Israel, becomes a
 * channel of the Spirit. His own will is suspended. The words come out of his
 * mouth and he cannot take them back.

    'Balaam the sorcerer was hired to curse Israel. Three times he climbed a high place with the king of Moab, burned offerings, and positioned himself to pronounce destruction. Three times the Spirit of God came upon him instead, and blessing poured out of his mouth. He could not stop it. By the fourth oracle, he stops even trying to hide what is happening: &ldquo;Now I cannot curse, because the Spirit is with you.&rdquo;',
    'The third oracle is a picture of Israel&apos;s beauty and God&apos;s pleasure in her. But the fourth — the oracle that becomes one of the Old Testament&apos;s most famous Messianic seeds — arrives without any attempt at enchantment. The Spirit comes. Balaam sees, and the prophecy that bursts out speaks of a Star and a Scepter that shall rise out of Jacob. Centuries of Jewish tradition, Christian interpretation, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Jesus&apos;s own followers all recognized what these words pointed to. This is the verse that made a rebel in 135 AD call himself Bar Kochba — the Son of the Star.',
