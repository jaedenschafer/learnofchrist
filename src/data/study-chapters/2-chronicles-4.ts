/**
 * 2 Chronicles 4 — The Temple Furnishings
 *
 * Solomon's artisans complete the great works of the Temple. An altar of brass,
 * vast as a small building. A molten sea, ten cubits across and five high, held
 * by twelve oxen—one for each tribe. Ten lavers for ritual cleansing. Ten golden
 * candlesticks. Ten tables for the showbread. One hundred golden basins. Every
 * implement fashioned for worship: light, bread, water, abundance without measure.
 * This is not merely the architecture of a building, but the visible expression
 * of a people's covenant — every piece made for the cleansing, the feeding, the
 * illumination of those who approach God.

    'The Temple is rising. Its walls are complete, its chambers built, its holy spaces prepared. Now comes the work that transforms a structure into a sanctuary — the furnishings that will make it a place where heaven and earth meet. The altar of brass. The molten sea. The lavers, the candlesticks, the tables, the basins. Each piece is designed to serve the priests as they carry out the ancient rhythms of worship. Some pieces are visible to all who enter; others stand only in the inner sanctuary, seen only by the high priest once a year. Yet all are essential. All speak to the same truth: a holy people must be prepared, cleansed, illuminated, and fed as they draw near to God.',
    'What strikes us as we read through this chapter is not merely the craftsmanship or the abundance of gold, though both are evident. What strikes us is the repetition: ten lavers, not one. Ten candlesticks, not one. Ten tables. This is not the work of one man, but the vision of a God who gathers the work of many, coordinates it all, and makes it serve a purpose far larger than any single artisan could imagine. And it is all done in bronze, silver, and gold — the materials of beauty and permanence, because the God who is worshiped deserves nothing less.',

The text names him not once but twice—"Huram made" and "Huram his father made"—emphasizing his central role. He is the one who understands how to translate the vision into reality. And his work spans everything: the pillars and their capitals, the wreaths and pomegranates, the sea and the oxen, every instrument. One man could not do all this alone, but one man—a gifted artisan—coordinates it all, brings it all together.',

Solomon makes the vessels "in great abundance"—so much brass, so many implements, so much metal that no one bothers to weigh it all. It is inexhaustible. It is beyond accounting. This is not the language of mere adequacy; this is the language of overflowing provision. God has given Solomon resources so vast that to ask "how much?" is almost irrelevant. The measure is not scarcity but abundance.',

Zeredathah may be another name for Zarethan, in the north. The point is that all this work—all this brass, all this abundance—is done in the land that God has given.
