/**
 * 1 John 1 — The Word of Life, Made Manifest
 *
 * John opens his epistle as John opened his Gospel: with the Word. But here, the Word
 * is not abstract theology—it is testimony. Something was seen, heard, touched. The Word
 * of life was manifested in the flesh. From this incarnate reality flows everything that
 * follows: God is light; in Him is no darkness at all. Believers walk in that light,
 * have fellowship with one another and with the Father, and are cleansed by the blood
 * of Christ. Yet the light also reveals sin. In response, confession—genuine agreement
 * with God about what we are—opens the way to forgiveness.

    'First John opens with the same three words Genesis and John&apos;s Gospel open with: "In the beginning." But John the Apostle is not speaking of creation. He is speaking of testimony. He has been there. He has seen. He has heard. He has touched. The Word of life—Jesus Christ—was made flesh, and John witnessed it. From this bedrock of eyewitness testimony, everything else in this epistle flows.',
    'The epistle then pivots to the nature of God: God is light. In Him dwells no darkness at all. This is not a poetic image. This is John&apos;s answer to a world drowning in deception and self-deception. To walk in light is to walk with God, to have true fellowship. Yet the light reveals. It exposes. It shows us ourselves as we truly are—sinners. How, then, do sinners stay in fellowship with a God who is pure light? By confession. Not by pretending to be sinless. Not by hiding. By naming sin, turning from it, and trusting in God&apos;s faithful, just forgiveness.',
    'This chapter is where incarnation meets ethics, where Christ&apos;s appearing meets our confession, where God&apos;s nature as light demands our honesty. It is the foundation of 1 John—and it is, in a quiet way, an answer to the loneliness so many feel: you are seen, you are known, you can come home.',
