/**
 * 2 Chronicles 2 — Solomon Prepares to Build the Temple
 *
 * Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the Lord. He conscripted
 * seventy thousand laborers, eighty thousand stonecutters, and thirty-six hundred
 * overseers. Then he wrote to Hiram of Tyre: "Send me cedar, fir, and algum
 * from Lebanon, for the house I build must be great, for our God is greater than
 * all gods." Hiram replied with blessing and sent Hiram-abi, a craftsman of
 * extraordinary skill. In this chapter, we see not just the building of a temple,
 * but a vision of how God works through human ingenuity, collaboration, and the
 * partnership of peoples to accomplish His purposes.

    'The second chapter of 2 Chronicles opens with Solomon&apos;s decision: he will build a house for the name of the Lord. Not for himself. Not for his glory. For the Lord&apos;s name. This distinction matters. Solomon is not building because he is ambitious; he is building because he has understood something about what his kingdom is for.',
    'What follows is a massive logistical enterprise. Seventy thousand men to bear burdens. Eighty thousand to hew in the mountains. Three thousand six hundred overseers to direct the work. But the chapter does not dwell on the burden or the weight. Instead, it turns to the correspondence between Solomon and Hiram, king of Tyre. Here we find something unexpected: a pagan king blessing the God of Israel. Here we find a craftsman so skilled, so laden with understanding, that he is named after his father&apos;s father — Hiram-abi, "Hiram my father." And in that collaboration, we see a truth about how God works: He accomplishes His purposes through human partnership, through the gifts of peoples beyond Israel, through the meeting of skill and vision.',

            'Throughout 2 Chronicles 2, the emphasis falls on craftsmanship — on skill, on understanding, on the ability to "find out every device." This echoes the Old Testament teaching that God Himself gives such skill. When God called Bezalel and Oholiab to build the tabernacle, He said, "I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in all manner of workmanship" (Exodus 31:3–5). The New Testament carries this forward. Paul teaches that the Spirit gives gifts — not just spiritual gifts, but practical ones. He writes, "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God" (1 Peter 4:10). The craftsman who builds with excellence is stewarding a divine gift.',

            'If Christ is the true Temple, then the church is being built by the Spirit — not with stone and cedar, but with living stones, as Peter teaches: "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house" (1 Peter 2:5). And just as Solomon called for the most skilled craftsmen, the Spirit equips the church with every needed gift. Each member brings a craft — some teaching, some helping, some healing, some exhortation. Paul writes, "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit" (1 Corinthians 12:4). The Spirit-empowered church is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, each part fitted together, the whole surpassing the sum of its parts.',
