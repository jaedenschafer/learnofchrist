/**
 * Luke 8 — The Word Sown and Demons Cast Out
 *
 * A sower goes forth to sow. Some seed falls by the wayside and is devoured.
 * Some falls on rock and withers. Some falls among thorns and is choked.
 * Some falls on good ground and brings forth fruit a hundredfold. "He that
 * hath ears to hear, let him hear." Jesus sails across the lake. A storm
 * arises. The disciples are afraid. Jesus rebukes the wind and the waves.
 * There is calm. In Gadarene country, a demon-possessed man meets Jesus.
 * Legion is his name. The demons beg not to be sent to the abyss. Jesus sends
 * them into a herd of swine. The swine run down a steep place and are drowned.
 * The man sits at Jesus&apos; feet, clothed, and in his right mind.

    'Jesus travels from city to city and village to village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. The twelve are with Him. Women also travel with Him, ministering to Him: Mary called Magdalene, from whom He had cast seven demons; Joanna; Susanna; and many others who give of their substance. He gathers a great multitude. He speaks to them in a parable: "A sower went out to sow his seed." Where the seed falls determines what comes forth. The same word produces different fruit depending on the heart that receives it.',
    'Jesus and His disciples get into a boat and sail across the lake. Jesus sleeps. A storm arises. The disciples are terrified. They wake Jesus: "Master, master, we perish!" Jesus rebukes the wind and the raging water. They cease. Calm comes. He says to His disciples: "Where is your faith?" But they are amazed. "What manner of man is this? for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."',
