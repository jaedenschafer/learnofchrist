/**
 * Psalm 115 — Glory to God Alone
 *
 * "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy
 * and for thy truth&apos;s sake." The psalmist refuses to accept praise or credit.
 * All glory belongs to God. The psalm then contrasts the living God with idols—
 * lifeless statues that have hands but cannot feel, ears but cannot hear. The God
 * we serve is alive, merciful, true. He is worthy of all glory.

    'Psalm 115 opens with a refusal. "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory." The psalmist will not accept honor or praise for himself. He knows that all glory belongs to God alone. And he knows why: "For thy mercy and for thy truth&apos;s sake." God is the source of all mercy and all truth. Any good that comes is because God is merciful and true. The psalmist is simply responding to what God has done.',
    'The psalm then builds a stark contrast: the living God versus lifeless idols. Idols have faces but cannot see, ears but cannot hear, noses but cannot smell. They are objects created by human hands, without consciousness or power. By contrast, the God Israel worships is alive. He sees, hears, acts. He is infinitely beyond the gods of gold and silver that the nations worship. And His people are invited to trust Him, to fear Him, to be blessed by Him.',

            '"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory." The repetition of "not unto us" is emphatic. The psalmist is refusing all claim to honor. Whatever has been accomplished, whatever good has come, all of it comes from God. The psalmist is a steward of God&apos;s mercy, not its owner. And the reason all glory goes to God is His mercy and truth. Everything flows from these qualities.',

But those who trust in the living God become alive, empowered, connected to His strength.',

He sees, hears, speaks, acts. He is not silent like the idols of silver and gold. His voice raises the dead. His touch heals the sick. He is the Image in which all who trust in Him are being transformed. [res:bible-odyssey-psalm-115]',
