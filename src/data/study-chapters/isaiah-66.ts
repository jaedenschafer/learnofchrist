/**
 * Isaiah 66 — God\'s Kingdom and Final Judgment
 *
 * "Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool."
 * The final chapter of Isaiah returns to God\'s majesty and power. Yet He stoops
 * to care for the humble and contrite. "Before she travailed, she brought forth"—
 * the nation will be born in a day. But judgment comes too: "Their worm shall not
 * die, neither shall their fire be quenched." The book of Isaiah ends with this
 * paradox: God\'s eternal kingdom and the final judgment. All things find their end
 * and their beginning in God.

    'Isaiah 66 is the culmination of the entire book. It begins with God\'s majesty: heaven is His throne, earth is His footstool. The temple will be destroyed and rebuilt. Nations will serve Israel. The Church will be born in a day. And yet, God\'s eye is on the humble and contrite, those who tremble at His word. The chapter ends with the vision of judgment: God will gather all nations and tongues to see His glory. All flesh will come to worship Him. But the wicked, those who rebel, will be judged. Their worm does not die. Their fire is not quenched. This is the final word: God\'s eternal kingdom, perfect justice, absolute judgment, and eternal mercy.',
