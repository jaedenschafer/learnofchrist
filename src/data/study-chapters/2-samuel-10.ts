/**
 * 2 Samuel 10 — David's Kindness Misread as Spying; The War That Follows
 *
 * The Ammonites insult David's emissaries of comfort, shaming them by cutting
 * off half their beards and their garments. David's response is a king's tenderness:
 * "Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown." But the shame of that moment
 * triggers a chain of alliances and battles — Ammonites and Syrians together
 * against Israel. In Joab's two-front strategy and military prayer — "Be of good
 * courage, let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God" —
 * we see a leader who turns to God when human strength is not enough. The chapter
 * ends in peace, but the path to it runs through humiliation, dignity, and the
 * grace a king extends to his servants.

    "After years of conquest and stability, David reaches out in kindness to the young king of Ammon, whose father had shown kindness to him in the past. It is the act of a king at peace—a reaching across old boundaries, a remembering of old debts. But the Ammonite princes, suspicious and threatened, convince the young king Hanun that David&apos;s servants are spies. What David intends as mercy, they read as deception.",
    "When kindness is rejected and turned to shame, when the king&apos;s servants are humiliated in front of all the people, David does not respond in anger. Instead, he shows his men a deeper dignity: &quot;Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, then return.&quot; The king cherishes the wounded honor of his servants. And when war comes—a two-front battle with Ammonites on one side and Syrian allies on the other—Joab leads with a prayer: &quot;Be of good courage... the Lord do that which seemeth him good.&quot; This chapter watches a leader learn that sometimes kindness is rejected, shame is real, and God is the only sufficient help.",

When David&apos;s servants were shamed, David did not abandon them. He honored their wound. He said: Tarry. Rest. Heal. Return when you are whole. This is the heart of a king who sees his servants as precious. And Jesus speaks in the same key: the disciples ask Him, "When saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison?" And He says: when you attended to the least among you, you attended to me. The King who will come sees the shamed and the wounded as His own people. His kindness extends to those whom the world has insulted. And He does not forget those who have shown kindness to His people—just as David remembered Nahash.',

He tended it. And then he went to war. There is a kind of love that honors those who are wounded. There is a king who sees your shame as real, your dignity as precious, and your healing as worth his time. Jesus is that King.',
