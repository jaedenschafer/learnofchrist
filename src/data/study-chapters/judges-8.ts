/**
 * Judges 8 — Gideon's Complete Victory and Decline
 *
 * From the height of victory (humbling Ephraim[res:bibleodyssey-gideon-ephraim], pursuing the Midianite kings)
 * to the snare of his own success (the ephod[res:sefaria-idolatry-gideon] becomes an idol), Judges 8 traces
 * the arc of a hero who refuses the crown but drifts into the sins of a king.
 * The chapter ends with Israel&apos;s instant apostasy after Gideon&apos;s death —
 * a generational warning that yesterday&apos;s deliverance does not save tomorrow&apos;s
 * people from their own faithlessness.

    'Gideon stands at the peak of his influence. The Midianites are broken; the 300 have proven mightier than thousands. But the moment after great victory is when the human heart is most at risk — when pride creeps in, when the instruments of salvation become objects of worship, when a deliverer begins to move like a king.',
    'Judges 8 tells two stories at once. First, the completion of Gideon&apos;s military victory: he pursues the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna to their final defeat. But alongside that triumph runs a darker current. Gideon&apos;s anger burns hotter. He makes threats he carries out. And when the people offer him a crown, he refuses it — yet then builds an ephod that becomes a snare. The chapter closes with Israel forgotten him immediately after his death, worshiping Baal[res:intertextual-judges-decline] again, and showing no gratitude to the man who delivered them. It is a portrait of how quickly we undo the work of God by turning the instruments of victory into idols.',
