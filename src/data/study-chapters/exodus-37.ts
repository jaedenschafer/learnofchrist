/**
 * Exodus 37 — Bezalel makes the sacred furnishings.
 *
 * Five times in six chapters God says "thou shalt make," and now Israel does it.
 * Bezalel and the craftsmen build the ark, the mercy seat with its cherubim, the
 * table of showbread, the lampstand of pure gold, the altar of incense, the anointing
 * oil and incense. Verse after verse: "And he made..." The repetition is not filler.
 * It is the echo of Genesis 1: "And God said... and it was so." Here, the word God
 * spoke five chapters earlier has become flesh in wood, gold, and flame. Where Israel
 * had failed before (the golden calf), they now obey. The pattern is itself a
 * foreshadowing: in John 1, the Word spoken from the beginning becomes the Word made
 * flesh. Here, the Word that said "make" becomes the made thing—the furnishings that
 * will meet God in the wilderness.

    'Exodus 37 opens with a word: &quot;And Bezalel made...&quot; After five chapters of blueprints, the work begins. God said. Now Israel obeys. Not halfway. Not with substitutions or shortcuts. Exactly as the LORD commanded. Verse by verse, the furniture appears: the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, the table, the lampstand, the altar of incense. Every piece matches the design. Every detail is kept.',
    'The repetition has theological weight that Bible readers often miss. Read Genesis 1 and you hear the rhythm: &quot;And God said... and it was so.&quot; Read Exodus 25&ndash;31 and you hear God&apos;s design: &quot;Thou shalt make...&quot; Read Exodus 37&ndash;39 and you hear obedience: &quot;And he made...&quot; Three chapters recording the same furnishings in the same order, because the point is not the furniture—the point is that the word God spoke has become the work the people have done. Before this, Israel had broken faith. They made the golden calf. But here, in the making of the sanctuary, Israel becomes the people who obey. And this obedience is a prophecy: it whispers ahead to John 1, where the Word that spoke all things into being becomes flesh and dwells among us.',
    'For the first time, the sanctuary is no longer a blueprint. It is real. Made. The God who said &quot;let there be light&quot; now says &quot;I will dwell among you,&quot; and His people make Him a home.',
