/**
 * 1 Samuel 4 — The Ark Captured; Ichabod
 *
 * Israel brings the ark into battle expecting magic, but learns that God cannot
 * be summoned or controlled — neither by Philistine capture nor by Israelite
 * presumption. The chapter chronicles the lowest point of pre-Davidic Israel:
 * defeat, the death of Eli, and the birth of a child named Ichabod ("where is
 * the glory?"), marking the moment the glory of the Lord withdrew from His people.

    'Israel and the Philistines meet for battle at Eben-ezer. Israel is defeated — 4,000 men slain. The elders of Israel, confounded by the loss, ask an ominous question: "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today?" Their answer is to fetch the ark of the covenant from Shiloh. Surely the ark, the symbol of God\'s presence, will turn the tide. But the text reveals a fatal confusion: they are treating a sacred object as if it were a talisman, a magical thing that can be carried into battle and guarantee victory. God is not owned. He cannot be used.',
    'The result is catastrophic. The Philistines, hearing the shout that erupts when the ark enters the camp, recognize immediately what has arrived. They are afraid — and they rise to meet the challenge. The second battle is far worse than the first. 30,000 Israelites fall. The ark is captured. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, are slain. When word reaches the aged Eli that his sons are dead and the ark is taken, he falls backward from his seat and dies, his neck broken.',
    'In that same hour, Phinehas\' wife gives birth to a son. Hearing the tidings, understanding in a moment that the glory has departed from Israel, she names him Ichabod — "where is the glory?" — and speaks the elegy of a nation: "The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken." The chapter ends at the nadir. Yet even here, God has not truly abandoned His people. The text is preparing the reader for what comes next: the story of David, the anointed king, and the long restoration.',

The same word, <em>kavod</em> — glory — is used. Israel experiences the withdrawal as absolute. But the Bible does not end there. The glory returns (Ezek. 43:4–5). And most radically: John 1:14 says the Word "became flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth." Jesus is the glory incarnate. The departure was real. But the return in Him is final and irrevocable.',

The ark will be returned. And centuries later, glory will appear in a child born in Bethlehem. The question "where is the glory?" is not the final word.
