/**
 * 3 Maccabees 6 — Eleazar&apos;s Prayer and God&apos;s Deliverance
 *
 * The climax of the 3 Maccabees narrative. Eleazar, the priest, old and beloved,
 * leads the people in a psalm-like prayer recalling God&apos;s deliverances: Pharaoh
 * and the Red Sea, Sennacherib, the three young men in the furnace, Daniel in the
 * lions&apos; den, Jonah from the whale&apos;s belly. His prayer pierces heaven. Just as
 * the elephants approach the entrance, God sends two angels visible to all —
 * striking terror into Ptolemy&apos;s army. The elephants turn upon their own troops.
 * Ptolemy&apos;s anger becomes repentance. He speaks gently to the Jews.

    'The moment of terror has arrived. Ptolemy&apos;s army, with five hundred elephants drunk on wine and incense, begins to move toward the Jews. But before the first elephant takes a step, an old man steps forward. Eleazar, the priest, beloved by the people, speaks. And his prayer becomes the heartbeat of the chapter — a recital of every great deliverance God has ever wrought.',
    'Prayer in Scripture is always remembrance. Eleazar does not plead in the abstract; he walks backward through history, naming each miracle, each rescue, each impossible reversal. Pharaoh drowned; Sennacherib fled; three young men walked unburned through fire; Daniel slept among lions; Jonah emerged from the belly. As he speaks, he teaches God&apos;s character through God&apos;s deeds. And the moment he finishes — the moment the prayer ends and human words give way to divine silence — God answers. Not with a quiet whisper. With visible messengers. With fear that turns back an empire.',

But every one of these is a foretaste of something greater. Christ is the deliverance that all the others were pointing toward. The Red Sea foreshadowed baptism — the passing through death into new life. The furnace foreshadowed the cross — the place where God&apos;s presence is closest. The lions&apos; den, the whale&apos;s belly — the grave itself. "And Jesus was raised on the third day" (1 Cor. 15:4). The ultimate reversal: the one in the tomb comes forth alive. The one in the power of the enemy escapes. The one with no strength becomes the power that undoes all powers. Eleazar&apos;s prayer reaches toward that moment, even though he cannot see it yet.',

            '"Tear up our sins, scatter our errors" — Eleazar&apos;s petition is answered, but not in the moment. It is answered on the cross. Paul writes to the Colossians about Jesus: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross" (Col. 2:14). The record is not merely hidden; it is nailed to Christ&apos;s body. The sins are not scattered vaguely; they are removed by His death. What Eleazar cried for — the erasing of the record — is exactly what Christ accomplishes by His blood. "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us" (Ps. 103:12).',

The Epistle to the Hebrews describes all angels as servants: "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (Heb. 1:14). They are the errand-runners of a God who will not leave His people without defense. Jesus Himself speaks of it: "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves… fear not… your Father knoweth" (Matt. 10:16, 26, 29). The angels who appear at 3 Maccabees 6 are part of the same ministry that surrounds the cross — where, in the darkest moment, Christ drinks the cup to deliver us all.',
