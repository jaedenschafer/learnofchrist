/**
 * Proverbs 31 — The Virtuous Woman and the Bride of Christ
 *
 * Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. Strength
 * and honour are her clothing. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a
 * woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. The book of Proverbs
 * closes with a portrait of virtue, the woman who understands her own worth and
 * the Lord&apos;s design.

    'The final chapter of Proverbs is the words of King Lemuel, which his mother taught him. It closes with an acrostic portrait of a virtuous woman—not a flat ideal, but a living person of accomplishment, dignity, and purpose. She is not passive. She works, builds, plants, trades, loves, teaches. Her strength comes not from physical power but from character rooted in the fear of the Lord. She is the answer to the question that opens the passage: "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies." The answer, implicitly, is: one who fears God.',
