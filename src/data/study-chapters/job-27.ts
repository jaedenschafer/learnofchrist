 * Job 27 — Job&apos;s Final Affirmation: Integrity Unto the End
 *
 * Job speaks for the last time in this section. "MY RIGHTEOUSNESS I HOLD FAST,
 * AND WILL NOT LET IT GO: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."
 * Job has suffered every indignity. His friends have accused him of invented
 * crimes. He has been stripped of everything. But he will not surrender his
 * integrity. He will not accept false confession. He will not deny the truth of
 * his own innocence. "As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment," Job
 * says. God has denied him judgment, God has embittered his soul. But God cannot
 * take away his righteousness, his integrity, his knowledge of his own innocence.
 * This is what remains when all else is stripped away: the knowledge of who you
 * are before God.',

    'Job speaks a final time, and his words are a summary and affirmation of everything he has defended throughout his suffering. "My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go." Job will not surrender his integrity. He will not accept the false accusations of his friends. He will not lie about his own innocence to purchase comfort or reconciliation. He has already lost everything else—his wealth, his children, his health, the support of his loved ones. But he still has one thing: his knowledge of his own integrity. And he will not surrender it.',
    'Job&apos;s affirmation is not an assertion of moral perfection. He is not saying he has never sinned, never erred, never missed the mark. Rather, he is saying that he has lived with integrity, that he has not committed the crimes he has been accused of, that his heart does not reproach him. He has lived as best he could according to his understanding. And in the face of suffering that seems undeserved, he will cling to that integrity. He will not betray who he is to satisfy the expectations of others. This is the final test: will Job compromise his truth to regain comfort?',
