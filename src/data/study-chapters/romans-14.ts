 * Romans 14 — The Weak and the Strong in Faith
 *
 * "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."
 * Some eat all things; others eat herbs. Neither should despise or judge the
 * other. "To his own master he standeth or falleth." "We shall all stand before
 * the judgment seat of Christ." "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth
 * not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth." "For whether we
 * live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord."

    'By Romans 14, Paul has laid doctrinal ground for eight chapters. Now he turns to the hardest question: How do Christians disagree without dividing? Some believers eat meat; others eat only vegetables. Some set one day above another; others count all days alike. To the strong, these rules feel like shadows. To the weak, they feel like walls. Both are sincere. Both believe they answer to God. And that last part—"answer to God"—is where Paul plants his flag.',
    'The chapter is not about food or calendars. It is about the church learning to hold disagreement differently. In a body where Christ is Lord, you cannot despise someone Christ died for. You cannot judge someone Christ will judge. You must bear the infirmities of the weak, not out of duty alone, but because you belong to Him. "To his own master he standeth or falleth." That master is Christ. Not you.',
    'Every verse in this chapter echoes with a kind of tenderness. Paul does not shame the weak for their scruples, nor the strong for their freedom. He asks each to see the other as Jesus sees them—to extend the grace they have received to brothers and sisters who walk differently.',
