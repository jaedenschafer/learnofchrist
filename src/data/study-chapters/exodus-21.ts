/**
 * Exodus 21 — The Book of the Covenant begins.
 *
 * The opening chapter of Israel&apos;s law code is a radical act of mercy.
 * God does not leave the freed slaves to decide justice themselves—He provides
 * a law. But the law is not what the ancient Near East expects. It protects
 * the servant, limits revenge, guards the vulnerable. Every verse assumes a
 * people who will be tempted by cruelty, and offers them a better way.
 *
 * At the heart of the chapter: "eye for eye." For centuries, this phrase has
 * been read as a license for revenge. But in ancient context, it was a CAP on
 * retaliation. In a world of blood feuds where a murder might ignite decades
 * of vendetta, this law says: justice must be proportional, nothing more. And
 * the chapter is filled with exceptions—with cases where the law leans toward
 * mercy instead. The pierced ear of the willing servant (vv.5–6) foreshadows
 * the One who would willingly become a servant to pay a debt He did not owe.

    'Exodus 21 opens the Book of the Covenant—Israel&apos;s first law code. It begins not with the weight of majesty or the terror of judgment, but with the laws of servants. God addresses a nation that has just been set free from slavery. The first law they hear is about protecting the enslaved. This is the shape of God&apos;s justice: the strong are bound by law to protect the weak.',
    'The chapter teaches limits. Limits on who can own a servant (Hebrews must be released in the seventh year). Limits on cruelty (if a master harms a servant, the servant goes free). Limits on revenge (the famous "eye for eye" is a ceiling, not a floor—it limits retaliation to what is proportional). Every law assumes a people prone to excess, and draws a line. In the middle of all these boundaries stands one phrase that echoes through the centuries: the pierced ear of the willing slave. A servant who chooses his master. A foreshadowing of One who would choose to become a servant to make us free.',
