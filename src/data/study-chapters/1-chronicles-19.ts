 * 1 Chronicles 19 — Hanun Shames David's Servants; War with Ammonites & Syrians
 *
 * When King Nahash of Ammon dies, David sends messengers to offer condolence
 * to his son Hanun. But Hanun's counselors convince him that the messengers
 * are spies. Humiliated, Hanun shaves David's servants, cuts their garments,
 * and sends them away. The shame becomes unbearable. David, whose first
 * impulse was kindness, responds with tender mercy: "Tarry at Jericho until
 * your beards be grown, then return." Yet the Ammonites, recognizing they
 * have made themselves odious to David, hire mercenaries—chariots and
 * horsemen—and prepare for war. Through brilliant military strategy and the
 * courage of Joab, David's forces overcome both the Ammonites and their
 * Syrian allies. The chapter teaches that kindness misread as weakness will
 * produce shame—but the response to shame is not revenge, but steady justice.

    'In the ancient Near East, a king&apos;s court was the seat of his authority. When David sends messengers to comfort the son of a former ally, he is extending the hand of a great king—one secure enough to offer kindness to a rival&apos;s heir. But Hanun listens to his counselors, men who see diplomacy as a cover for espionage. The result is one of Scripture&apos;s most painful moments: David&apos;s servants are stripped and shamed, half their beards shaved, their garments cut off at the buttocks. It is a humiliation so severe that grown men hide in shame. Yet David&apos;s response is not to match their cruelty with cruelty. It is to protect his servants&apos; dignity by letting them heal. "Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown."',
    'What follows is not a story of a king avenging an insult, though David certainly has the right. Instead, it is a story of how a kingdom responds when kindness is weaponized against it, when mercy is read as weakness. Joab faces a war on two fronts—Ammonites at the gate of the city, Syrian mercenaries in the field. His response is a masterclass in strategy, courage, and prayer. He divides his forces, puts himself against the stronger enemy, and then—in words that echo through centuries—calls out to his men: "Be of good courage, let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight." The victory that follows belongs to God.',

            'Joab prayed: "let the Lord do that which is good in his sight." The outcome is indeed good—a complete victory, the decimation of the enemy, and the restoration of David&apos;s honor. "Good" in Scripture often means not merely pleasant, but righteous and just. This victory is good because it restores justice after the insult to David&apos;s servants.',

Their servants—the armies of Hadarezer—see that they are being "put to the worse before Israel," and they make peace with David. They become his servants; they will no longer fight for Ammon. The mercenary alliance crumbles. Ammon stands alone, and the war is effectively over.',

            'David&apos;s response to the shaming of his servants reveals the character of a true king: first, he attends to their dignity ("Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown"); second, he pursues justice with unwavering purpose; third, he does so not for revenge, but to defend those under his care and to restore right order in the kingdom. Jesus, speaking to His disciples, uses language that echoes David&apos;s care: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father... Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows" (Matthew 10:29–31). Christ honors His servants. He does not allow their shame to stand unanswered. And when He goes to the cross, He does so not to avenge Himself, but to restore all who believe to their true dignity—"heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17). The victory is not about defeating enemies; it is about the restoration of the beloved.',

David models a king who does both: he protects his servants immediately (letting them heal in Jericho), and he pursues justice carefully and thoroughly. But he does so without cruelty, without humiliating in return. Justice is not revenge. It is the restoration of right order.',
