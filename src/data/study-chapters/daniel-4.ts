/**
 * Daniel 4 — The Tree and the King
 *
 * Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree that reaches to heaven. A holy watcher
 * decrees that the tree shall be cut down; the stump shall remain. The king shall
 * eat grass as oxen, driven from men, until he knows that "the most High ruleth in
 * the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." The dream comes to
 * pass. Nebuchadnezzar is humbled, made mad, eating grass for seven years until
 * his reason returns and he lifts his eyes to heaven. "Those that walk in pride he
 * is able to abase."

    'This chapter is unusual among the chapters of Daniel: it is narrated in the king&apos;s own voice. Nebuchadnezzar himself recounts his dream and its terrible fulfillment. At ease in his palace, regarding his power and glory, he has a dream that troubles him. He sees a great tree in the midst of the earth, so high it reaches to heaven. The fruit is abundant, the leaves are fair, the beasts of the field find shade under it. But a holy watcher cries out, and the tree is hewn down. Only the stump remains, banded with a band of iron and brass.',
    'The dream continues. The stump shall become like the heart of a beast, not a man. For seven times—seven years—the king shall eat grass like oxen, driven from the dwelling of men, until he comes to know a truth that towers over him as the tree towered over the earth: that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. And what seems like madness is in fact the mercy of God, teaching the mightiest king on earth the humility that alone makes a man truly great.',

Or more likely, he remembers but refuses to accept that his power comes from any hand but his own. And in that moment—while the pride is still on his lips—the word falls from heaven. The kingdom is departed. And what was a dream becomes a terrible waking reality. The tree is hewn down. The king eats grass. His hair grows like eagles&apos; feathers.

This is not a legal transaction, but a truth about the structure of the kingdom of God. Pride closes the door to grace. Humility opens it. In the garden of Gethsemane, Christ exemplifies this. Despite His power and glory, He bows Himself before the Father: "Not my will, but thine, be done." And through that humility—through the cross, through death—He enters into glory such as the kings of the earth can never possess. The way up is the way down. The way to greatness is the way of laying down your life.',
