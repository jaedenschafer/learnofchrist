/**
 * 1 Peter 1 — Living Hope in Scattering
 *
 * Peter writes to believers scattered across the Roman world—foreigners and
 * pilgrims, vulnerable, displaced, facing hostility. His letter lifts their
 * eyes from their circumstances to the reality beneath: they are begotten again
 * to a lively hope through Christ's resurrection, heirs to an inheritance
 * that cannot fade. Their faith, tested by fire, is more precious than gold.
 * They love the Christ they have not seen. And in their suffering, they are
 * following the One whose blood redeemed them—the Lamb without blemish,
 * foreordained before the foundation of the world.

    'First Peter is written to scattered believers—people who have been driven out of their homes, living as foreigners in hostile territory. They face pressure from the culture around them, the loss of security, the daily weight of being "other." Peter does not console them by promising an easy life. Instead, he anchors them in a deeper reality: they have been born again to a living hope, and their inheritance in heaven is secure and cannot be taken from them.',
    'The theme running through this chapter is hope that holds steady when circumstances collapse. This hope is not optimism that things will work out. It is the unshakeable confidence that Christ has risen, that God has seated Him at His right hand, that the resurrection is the proof that death itself does not have the final word. For believers scattered and pressed, hope becomes the daily air they breathe.',
