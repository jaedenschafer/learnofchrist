/**
 * Psalm 17 — Vindication and Transformation
 *
 * "Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry." David pleads his case before God
 * with the confidence of innocence. "Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under
 * the shadow of thy wings." He asks for protection[res:bible-odyssey-justice-prayer], for refuge, for the tender care
 * of God. And he concludes with a stunning affirmation: "I shall be satisfied, when
 * I awake, with thy likeness." Transformation, not merely vindication, is the goal.

    'Psalm 17 combines two themes that might seem contradictory: a plea for vindication and a longing for transformation. David asks God to hear his cry, to examine his heart, to protect him from those who oppress him. He asks to be kept as the apple of God&apos;s eye, that most tender and carefully guarded part of the body. Yet alongside this plea for protection runs a deeper longing: to awake one day transformed into Christ&apos;s likeness. The psalm is not ultimately about winning against enemies. It is about becoming like God.',
    'This is a psalm for those who have learned that the real battle is internal, that vindication matters less than transformation, that the goal of the spiritual life is not merely to be proven right but to be made right—to be conformed to God&apos;s image.',
