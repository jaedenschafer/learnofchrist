/**
 * Revelation 8 — The Seventh Seal Opens to Silence; The Seven Trumpets Begin
 *
 * When the Lamb opens the seventh seal, there is silence in heaven for about half an hour.
 * All the majesty of heaven falls still. Then the silence breaks. Seven angels are given
 * seven trumpets. An angel stands at the golden altar with much incense, offering the prayers
 * of the saints before God. Fire from the altar is cast to the earth—and voices, thunderings,
 * lightnings, and an earthquake answer. Then the trumpets begin. Four trumpets sound in quick
 * succession, each bringing judgment upon the earth: hail and fire mingled with blood consuming
 * a third of the trees and grass; a great burning mountain cast into the sea, turning a third
 * of the water to blood; the star Wormwood falling, making a third of the rivers and fountains
 * bitter; a third of the sun, moon, and stars darkened. And in the silence after the fourth
 * trumpet, a voice calls out: "Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of
 * the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound."

    'In Revelation 7, John saw the multitude of the redeemed standing before the throne, clothed in white robes, palms in their hands, singing the song of salvation. The vision was one of triumph and vindication. And then—the seventh seal. The Lamb opens it, and heaven itself goes silent. Not the silence of emptiness, but of terrible hush. Something momentous is about to unfold.',
    'The focus shifts from the throne of God to the altar. An angel stands before the golden censer with incense, which is the prayers of all the saints. These prayers—the cries of the redeemed, their pleas for justice, their intercessions for the world—rise up before God. The angel then fills the censer with fire from the altar and casts it to the earth. And what follows is the sounding of the trumpets, each one announcing a fresh judgment upon the world. The chapter does not reveal what these judgments mean in history or chronology—it calls you to watch, to listen, and to see your own prayers meeting the altar of heaven itself.',

The designation "woe" in Scripture marks catastrophe and judgment. Jesus Himself pronounced "woe" upon the Pharisees and teachers of the law—not in malice, but in sorrow, marking the consequence of their hardness of heart. Here, the angel announces that what has come so far is only the beginning. Three more trumpets remain.',

In each case, the woe marks not the end of a story, but a reckoning—the moment when choices made in darkness are brought into light, when the consequences of rejecting God&apos;s truth come home. And even in pronouncing woe, Jesus weeps over Jerusalem: "How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" (Matthew 23:37). The woes of Revelation 8:13 are similarly not detached from God&apos;s heart. They are the cry of heaven mourning over those who refuse to turn.',

And they are announced in advance, not to terrify, but to call you to your senses. The voice of the angel flying through heaven is not the voice of a tyrant.
