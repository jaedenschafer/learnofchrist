/**
 * Ruth 2 — Ruth Meets Boaz
 *
 * Naomi's kinsman-redeemer appears on the horizon. Ruth, gleaning in the field,
 * finds herself in the exact place where grace is waiting. Every gesture Boaz makes—
 * from his greeting to his workers, to his protective charge, to his table invitation—
 * prefigures Christ's redemptive work.
 *
 * Key themes:
 * - Coincidence is God's incognito (Augustine)
 * - The gleaning law: God's economy for the poor and foreigner
 * - The kinsman-redeemer (go'el) pattern
 * - Boaz as a type of the Greater Redeemer
 * - "Under whose wings thou art come to trust"

    'Ruth 2 opens with a woman in desperate need. Naomi\'s widow and foreigner, with nothing. But instead of despair, she has a plan: go to the fields at harvest time and glean—pick up the grain left behind by the reapers, which the law protected for the poor and the stranger.',
    'What unfolds is one of Scripture\'s most tenderly told stories of divine providence. Ruth\'s decision to glean seems small. Her "hap"—her chance—to light on one particular field seems like luck. But the reader knows what Ruth doesn\'t: she has just walked into a field where grace is waiting in the form of Boaz, a man of kindness and integrity, already known as a redeemer. By the end of the chapter, he will have given her more grain than she earned, invited her to his table, and charged his workers to protect her. He is already redeeming her—before he ever formally becomes her kinsman-redeemer.',
