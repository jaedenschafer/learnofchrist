 * Proverbs 18 — The Strong Tower and the Closer Brother
 *
 * The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it,
 * and is safe. There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. This
 * chapter celebrates the refuge found in God&apos;s name and the extraordinary
 * bond of true friendship.

    'In Proverbs 18, Solomon reaches toward two of the deepest truths: that God&apos;s name is a strong tower of protection and refuge, and that there exists a friendship so profound it surpasses even the bond of blood kinship. These are not abstract theological statements. They are lived realities—the person who has fled into the refuge of God&apos;s name, and the person who has found a friend who stands nearer than a sibling ever could.',

It is to enter into the reality that the Lord is who His name declares Him to be: the Almighty, the Everlasting One, the God of Covenant. In that reality, the righteous are safe.[res:british-museum-amenemope]',

This is not a friend you cultivate. This is a friend who has become more intimate than blood kinship. Sticketh suggests adherence, clinging, a bond not easily broken.[res:sefaria-proverbs-18]',
