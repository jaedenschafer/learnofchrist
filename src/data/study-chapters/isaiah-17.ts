/**
 * Isaiah 17 — Burden of Damascus: The Brevity of Empire, Eternity of Kingdom
 *
 * The oracle against Damascus declares that the great city and its surrounding
 * kingdom will diminish until it becomes like the gleaning left after harvest—
 * a remnant of a remnant. Yet within this word of judgment lies a deeper promise:
 * the eyes of Israel will turn to their Maker, and though judgment comes, the
 * eternal kingdom of God will endure when earthly powers crumble to dust.

    "Damascus was the capital of Aram, a kingdom that had long opposed Israel. Its fall, the prophet announces, is certain and swift. The city that seemed mighty and permanent will become insignificant, stripped of glory as a harvested field is stripped of grain. But the prophecy carries more than a word of doom. It contains within it a promise of hope: Israel itself, though diminished by judgment, will turn its eyes back to its Maker, and the covenant God has not abandoned His people.",
    'Isaiah 17 teaches a profound lesson about the nature of kingdoms and power. All earthly dominions, no matter how great, are temporary. They rise and fall, grow and diminish. Only the kingdom of God endures. Even when Israel faces judgment, the word is not one of final abandonment but of eventual restoration.',

Damascus will become a "ruinous heap," a place of rubble where once stood the seat of power. The prophet then expands the vision: not only Damascus, but Aroer and the fortifications of Ephraim, the very structures that represent political might and security. They shall be forsaken.[res:sefaria-isaiah-17]',
