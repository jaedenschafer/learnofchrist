/**
 * Numbers 29 — The fall feasts. The liturgical calendar of ancient Israel reaches
 * its climax in the seventh month (Tishrei). Three feasts unfold in sequence:
 *
 * TRUMPETS (1st day of the 7th month): A holy convocation marked by the blowing
 * of trumpets — a call to remember God's kingship, gather the people, and sanctify
 * the year. The offerings foreshadow the Last Trumpet.
 *
 * DAY OF ATONEMENT (10th day): The holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The high
 * priest enters the Holy of Holies alone (the only day he ever does), carrying the
 * blood of the sin offering to sprinkle on the mercy seat. "Afflict your souls"
 * becomes the command — fast, confess, cease from work. Israel stands before God
 * with all its sins laid bare, and the scapegoat is sent into the wilderness
 * bearing those sins away.
 *
 * TABERNACLES (15th–22nd days): The longest festival, seven days + an eighth-day
 * assembly. The people dwell in booths (sukkah) remembering the wilderness journey.
 * They rejoice before the Lord. Water is drawn and poured over the altar (the
 * "water libation" — not commanded in Leviticus but practiced in Jesus's day).
 *
 * THE DECREASING BULLS — A beautiful hidden pattern: during Tabernacles, the
 * number of bulls offered decreases each day: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 = 70 total.
 * Rabbinic tradition: one bull for each of the 70 nations of the world. The message:
 * Israel's feast encompasses all nations in God's sight.
 *
 * CHRIST: On Tabernacles, Jesus stood in the temple and cried: "If any man thirst,
 * let him come unto me, and drink" (John 7:37). The festival of rejoicing points
 * to the one who satisfies all thirst. The decreasing sacrifice pattern points to
 * the ONE LAMB whose single offering suffices for all peoples: "Thou wast slain,
 * and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and
 * people, and nation" (Revelation 5:9).
 *
 * VOICE: The festival rhythm is the gospel rhythm in miniature. Year after year,
 * the people gather, they suffer (Atonement), they confess, they are restored, and
 * then they REJOICE. The same arc: conviction, confession, cleansing, celebration.
 *
 * 56 verses. Minimum 3 Christ connections (Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles).

    'The liturgical calendar of ancient Israel reaches its climax in the seventh month. Three feasts crowd together in rapid succession—a season when the whole nation gathers before God to mark time, confess sin, and rejoice. Trumpets announce the beginning. Ten days later, on the Day of Atonement, the high priest enters the Holy of Holies alone—the only day of the year he does so. Then comes Tabernacles: seven days of living in booths, eating without houses, sleeping under the stars, remembering the wilderness journey and God\'s provision.',
    'Buried in the numbers of Tabernacles is a hidden pattern. The bulls offered during the feast decrease each day: 13, then 12, then 11, on down to 7. Total: 70 bulls. Seventy is the number of nations in the ancient world—the rabbis understood immediately that Israel\'s feast encompassed all peoples in God\'s accounting. And beyond the feast, in John\'s Gospel, Jesus stands at Tabernacles and cries: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink." The festivals point to Him. The decreasing sacrifice—multiple animals each day—points to the ONE who would come. Revelation says it plainly: "Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."',
    'But before the joy of Tabernacles comes the ache of Atonement. Before the feast comes the fast. The gospel rhythm is written into Israel\'s year: confrontation with sin, confession before God, cleansing by blood, and then—celebration. Year after year, the same arc. And year after year, the sacrifices point forward, waiting for the one offering that will end all others.',
