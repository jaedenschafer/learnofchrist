/**
 * Exodus 17 — Water from the rock and victory in battle.
 *
 * Two connected scenes. In the first, Israel is thirsty in the wilderness
 * and Moses cries to God. God tells him to strike the rock at Horeb; water
 * flows out. In the second, Amalek attacks and Moses holds up his hands
 * while Joshua fights. When Moses&apos; hands are lowered in exhaustion, the
 * battle turns against Israel. Aaron and Hur hold up his arms until sunset,
 * and Israel prevails. The rock is named Massah and Meribah (testing and
 * strife). The place is called Jehovah-Nissi: the LORD is my banner.
 *
 * Paul tells the Corinthians that the rock that followed Israel was Christ
 * (1 Corinthians 10:4). The rock is struck once, and water flows. This
 * becomes a type of the cross—struck once for all. When Moses later strikes
 * the rock twice (Numbers 20:11) instead of speaking to it, the typology
 * breaks and he is barred from the land. The image of Moses&apos; lifted hands
 * anticipates the lifted hands of Christ on the cross, and Aaron and Hur
 * prefigure the body of believers holding up the work when the leader is weak.

    'Exodus 17 shows Israel learning two hard lessons at the edge of the wilderness. First, that survival depends not on what they can find or do for themselves, but on God willing to provide in places where nothing grows. Second, that even when God has called you and promised to fight for you, the victory still requires somebody to stand and hold up the work while others fight. These are the lessons of a people learning to depend on God and on each other.',
    'The chapter contains two of the most important types of Christ in all of exodus. The rock at Horeb, struck by Moses&apos; rod and flowing with water, becomes in Paul&apos;s reading the physical manifestation of Christ—the one struck for all sin, whose wounds become the source of living water. And the image of Moses standing with his arms held high, his hands held up by Aaron and Hur, becomes a picture of the cross itself: the victory won not by strength, but by faithful endurance, upheld by the community around the leader.',
    'Read this chapter watching for the pattern that repeats throughout scripture: when Israel is in the wilderness, what they need is not a map or supplies, but the presence of God. The water comes not from well-digging or technology, but from a rock the people have not yet learned to trust. And the battle is won not by the fighting strength of Joshua and Israel, but by the faithfulness of one man holding up his hands—a work the community had to learn to uphold.',

            'Moses standing on the hill with his arms held high is one of scripture&apos;s most direct foreshadows of the cross. Christ&apos;s arms, lifted in sacrifice, achieve the victory over all spiritual enemies. Unlike Moses, whose hands grew weary and had to be held up by others, Christ&apos;s arms never sink. But the image tells you something about what the cross is doing: it is intercession. It is the one standing in the gap between God and the people. And it is the only victory that ever lasted because the arms holding it up never grew weary and never came down.',

Your hands will grow heavy. You need an Aaron and a Hur. Ask for help. Accept the stone they place under you. Let them hold up your arms. And if you are the Aaron or Hur—the one in the community watching the leader grow weary—don&apos;t wait to be asked. Put a stone in place. Stand on both sides. Hold the arms up. This is what the church is for: this is when the body becomes the body. The leader who stands alone will fall. And the work that is not upheld by the community will not survive.',
