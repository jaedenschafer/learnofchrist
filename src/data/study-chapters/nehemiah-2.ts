/**
 * Nehemiah 2 — The King Grants the Request & Nehemiah Surveys the Walls
 *
 * Nehemiah stands before the king of Persia, sorrow heavy in his heart. The
 * king sees his sadness and asks why — and in that moment of vulnerability,
 * Nehemiah prays. An instant prayer, breathed in the presence of the monarch
 * himself. Then he speaks: send me to rebuild Jerusalem. The king grants the
 * request and gives him letters, protection, and timber. But opposition waits.
 * Sanballat and Tobiah hear of the plan and are grieved — not for Nehemiah's
 * sake, but that someone has come "to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
 * Nehemiah surveys the walls by night, tells no one what God has put in his heart,
 * then rallies the people: "Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem."
 * The work begins. The opposition declares itself. And the builder moves forward.

    'Nehemiah stands in the palace of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, bearing wine as he has done before. But on this day, his heart is burdened. The city of his fathers lies waste. The walls are broken. The gates are consumed with fire. And it shows on his face. The king sees his sadness and asks: "Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart."',
    'What happens next is breathtaking in its simplicity. "So I prayed to the God of heaven" — an instant prayer, no time to prepare, no withdrawal into prayer closet. In the presence of the most powerful man on earth, Nehemiah turns his heart to heaven. And then he speaks his request. He asks the king to send him to Judah, to rebuild the city. The king asks how long he will be gone. Nehemiah gives a time. The king grants the request. And he gives Nehemiah more than he asked for — letters to the governors, a letter to the keeper of the forest for timber, and an armed escort.',
    'But the moment Nehemiah arrives in Jerusalem, he discovers that his coming has been noticed. Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite hear of it, and we are told: "It grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel." His very presence is an affront to them. So Nehemiah does what any good leader would do. He arrives, waits three days, then in the night — alone, with only a beast to carry him — he rises and surveys the walls. He says nothing to the rulers, the priests, the nobles, or the rest. He has a vision from God, and he is careful with it until he is ready. Then, having seen the full scope of the work, he calls the people together and speaks those world-changing words: "Ye see the distress that we are in... Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach." And they answer: "Let us rise up and build." Opposition appears immediately — but the work has begun.',

Nehemiah embodies this paradox: he prays as if everything depends on God, then works as if everything depends on him. He speaks with the authority God has given him, and the people rise to build. The church is built this way — through leaders who have prayed, who have seen the vision clearly, and who speak with the authority that God has already granted.',
