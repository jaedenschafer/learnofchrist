/**
 * 1 Samuel 31 — The Death of Saul on Mount Gilboa
 *
 * The long story of Saul ends in tragedy and fire. On the slopes of Mount Gilboa,
 * Israel falls before the Philistines. Saul, wounded and refusing the mercy of
 * an enemy blade, falls upon his own sword. His sons — Jonathan, Abinadab, and
 * Melchishua — fall with him. The Philistines desecrate what remains of the king.
 * But the men of Jabesh-gilead, remembering how Saul once saved them from utter
 * destruction, come in the night to recover his body and give him honor in death.
 * This is how 1 Samuel ends — not with conquest, not with a throne secure, but
 * with fire and gratitude, and the knowledge that a new king is coming.

    'The book of Samuel has been the story of a kingdom divided — of a king who refused to listen, of a prophet who grieved the road that king chose, of a young man waiting in exile for a throne that was always his. Now the story reaches its end. Saul has been hunting David across the wilderness. The Philistines have been gathering. And on the mountain of Gilboa, everything that Saul built falls to dust.',
    'First Samuel ends not with David crowned, not with Saul deposed in peace, but with the death of a king who would not obey. Yet even in that ending, there is grace — for the men who once served Saul, broken and defeated as they were, remember who he was before fear took him. They come by night, when enemies surround them, to burn his body and bury his bones with honor. That is the last light in Saul&apos;s story: that someone remembered the man he had been.',

            'Saul&apos;s death and the death of Christ are as opposite as opposite can be. Saul falls upon his own sword in fear and despair, seeking escape from his enemies. Jesus walks toward the cross in love, choosing sacrifice for the sake of His beloved. Saul&apos;s kingdom ends in humiliation and desecration. Christ&apos;s death opens a new covenant: "Behold, I come not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give my life a ransom for many" (Matt. 20:28). Saul dies in disobedience, the end-point of a life spent refusing the Lord. Jesus says in the garden, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). And where Saul&apos;s body is hung in shame and dismay, Christ is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea — a man who, like the men of Jabesh-Gilead, remembered kindness and risked everything to honor the one who had fallen. The difference: Saul&apos;s story ends in the grave. Christ rises on the third day, breaking the power of death itself.',

They remembered him as he was in his beginning: the man who gathered Israel and defeated their enemy. They came in the night. They took the body from the wall. They burned it. They buried the bones. They fasted. This is how we choose to be remembered. Not by what we end as, but by who we were when we loved best. And if the people we once served are willing to come for us in the dark, willing to risk everything to recover what was lost — that is a kind of redemption, even in death. That is grace.',
