/**
 * 2 Esdras 2 — The Indictment Ends, a New People Begins
 *
 * The second chapter of 2 Esdras marks a dramatic pivot. God has finished
 * speaking through His prophets to Israel; the old covenant people have
 * rejected them all. But God does not withdraw His promise. Instead, He
 * announces a radical expansion: the Gentiles—the nations outside the
 * covenant—are now called to inherit the promise. A mother embraces her
 * children with a tenderness that echoes the prophets. An innumerable
 * multitude gathers on Mount Sion, crowned with victory, worshipping the
 * Lamb. Among them stands a young man of surpassing stature, setting crowns
 * on every head. Early Christian readers saw in that young man the risen
 * Christ crowning the saints.

    'For chapters 1–7, God has sent prophet after prophet to Israel, and all have been rejected. The old covenant people have hardened their hearts. Now comes the judgment: God will turn away from them and call a new people—the Gentiles. But this is not judgment alone; it is a radical opening of the ancient promise.',
    'As Ezra listens, the scene shifts. A mother—perhaps the Zion of old—is urged to embrace a new family. The Gentiles pour in from every direction, leaving their idols behind, inheriting everlasting tabernacles that neither moth nor rust can consume. And in a vision granted to Ezra, the church of the redeemed appears: an innumerable multitude crowned with palms, singing before the Lord. Among them walks a figure of surpassing beauty and strength, placing a crown on every single head. The ancient Fathers read this as a vision of the Lamb on Mount Sion, crowned in glory, crowning His bride.',
