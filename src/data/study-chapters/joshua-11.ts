/**
 * Joshua 11 — The Northern Campaign
 *
 * A watershed chapter in Israel&apos;s conquest. The northern kingdoms unite
 * against Joshua, God reassures him (echoing the opening of the conquest),
 * and Israel wins decisively at the waters of Merom[res:bibleodyssey-merom-waters]. The chapter pivots on
 * obedience: Joshua houghs horses and burns chariots (rejecting Canaanite
 * war technology), destroys the Anakim giants, and leaves the land at rest[res:intertextual-rest-hebrews-4].
 * Christ echoes in the rest that Hebrews 4 says still awaits believers.

    'Joshua 11 is the turning point of Israel&apos;s conquest. After a series of southern victories, Jabin king of Hazor[res:iaa-hazor-conquest] learns the news and decides to take action. He forges a coalition of northern kings — "as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many" — a force so overwhelming that an ancient reader would have trembled. But God&apos;s first word to Joshua is the same one He spoke at the very beginning of the conquest: "Be not afraid."',
    'What follows is both a military account and a theological blueprint. Joshua refuses to adopt the war technology of the nations. The Anakim giants — the very ones who terrified the spies in Numbers 13 — are finally destroyed. And when the smoke clears, the land rests. For the first time in the book, there is peace.',
