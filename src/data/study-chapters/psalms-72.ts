 * Psalm 72 — The Davidic King
 *
 * "Give the king[res:sefaria-psalms-72] thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king&apos;s
 * son." This is a royal psalm, a prayer for a just and merciful king who will
 * defend the poor and needy. The Church has seen in this psalm a foreshadowing
 * of Christ[res:intertextual-psalms-72-nt], the King whose justice and mercy are perfect, whose reign extends
 * over all the earth.

    'Psalm 72 is a royal prayer. It begins: "Give the king thy judgments, O God." The prayer is that the king would be filled with God&apos;s justice, that he would rule not by his own wisdom, but by God&apos;s justice. And this justice has a particular direction: "He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment."',
    'The psalm paints a vision of a king whose reign brings peace and prosperity, who crushes the oppressor, who defends the weak. This vision goes beyond any earthly king. Even the greatest kings of Israel fell short of this standard. And yet the psalm persists: "His name shall endure for ever...all nations shall call him blessed." The Church recognizes in this psalm the true King, Jesus Christ, whose reign is eternal and universal.',
